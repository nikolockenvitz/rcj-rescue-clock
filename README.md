# rcj-rescue-clock

This is a Progressive Web App to measure the time at RoboCup Junior (Rescue).
It's available on [nikolockenvitz.github.io/rcj-rescue-clock](https://nikolockenvitz.github.io/rcj-rescue-clock).
You can also get there by scanning the QR code below.

</p>

You can start and stop the time and see the past and remaining time.
It will also play an alert if the time is over.

Since it's a PWA, you can "install" it and add it to your home screen (runs offline).
