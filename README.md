# rcj-rescue-clock

This is a Progressive Web App to stop the time during RoboCup Rescue.
The productive version is available on [nikolockenvitz.github.io/rcj-rescue-clock](https://nikolockenvitz.github.io/rcj-rescue-clock).
You can also get there by scanning the QR-Code below.
Development takes place on [nikolockenvitz.de/rcjclock](https://nikolockenvitz.de/rcjclock).

</p>

You can start and stop the time and see the past and remaining time.
It will also play an alert if the time is over.

Since it is a PWA you can "install" it and add it to your home screen so it will run offline.
